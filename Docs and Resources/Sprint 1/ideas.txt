TRAP IDEA:
User enters room
All Exits are blocked
3 "Seeds?" spawn and begin moving in a random direction
When a seed hits a wall or another seed it will ricochet(sp?) and keep moving
User must reach a button on the other side of the room without hitting the seeds to destroy them and open the exits
User dies if a seed is touched
Could have a series of rounds with more seeds (final boss before moving to next fruit?)
